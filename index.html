        A prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the
        world's best players before age 20. Diego Maradona considered the
        18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho,
        while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the Ballon d'Or,
        commented, "I'm not even the best at Barça", in reference to his
        protégé.Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a
        record margin, the public debate regarding his qualities as a player
        moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that
        he was one of the greatest players in history. An early proponent was
        his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared
        Messi to be the best player he had ever seen.
